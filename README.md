Welcome to our Memory Game! This game challenges your memory by asking you to match pairs of cards hidden on the board. Below are some details about how we built this game and the resources we utilized.

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

We implemented the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) to create a custom class for the game. This class handles the functionality of the game board and card interactions. Through OOP, we were able to organize our code efficiently and make it easier to manage.

## Technologies Used

### HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

We utilized HTML for structuring the content, CSS for styling the layout and design, and JavaScript for adding interactivity to the game.

### Sass

Sass was used as a preprocessor for CSS, providing us with features like variables, nesting, and mixins to streamline our styling process.

### Bundling and Modules

To manage our JavaScript code more effectively, we employed bundling and modules. Bundling allowed us to combine multiple JavaScript files into a single bundle for optimized loading, while modules enabled us to organize our code into reusable components.

## External Resources

### Bundling Assistance

We referred to a video tutorial on Professor Marcos's homepage to assist us with bundling. The tutorial provided valuable insights into bundling techniques, helping us optimize our workflow. You can find the tutorial [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02ehdTzi3I).

### Reset Button Implementation

For implementing the reset button functionality, we found guidance on Stack Overflow. The provided code snippet helped us create a reset button that effectively resets the game board when clicked. You can view the discussion [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71475445/restart-button-using-html-js).

### Tutor Support

During our development process, we received assistance from a tutor named Tiffany.  Tiffany recommended a helpful resource, [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/), which offered further insights into OOP and module usage.

## Instructions

To play the Memory Game, simply click on the cards to reveal them. Try to match each card with its twin. If the cards don't match, they will flip back over. Your goal is to remember the locations of the cards and match them all to clear the board.

Enjoy the game and test your memory skills!
